## What Occupations do Software Developers Marry?

Now aside from this graph being misleading because software developers' love lives are nonexistent, there does seem to be a chance they fall in love with other software developers. They also often tying the knot with elementary and middle school teachers, nice. Dive a bit deeper, and you'll find devs cozying up with managers, nurses, and accountants. And for those who truly want to keep work talk at bay, there's always the option of customer service reps and retail salespersons. Love truly knows no bounds (or job descriptions)! üíª‚ù§Ô∏èüçé

After not very careful examination of this graph I think the best action to take is to quit being a software enginner, become a middle school teacher and then marry with a software enginner. Everyone wins. Cheers.
