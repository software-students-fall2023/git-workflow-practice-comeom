Now aside from this graph being misleading because software developers' love lives are nonexistent, there does seem to be a chance they fall in love with other software developers. They also often tying the knot with elementary and middle school teachers, nice. Dive a bit deeper, and you'll find devs cozying up with managers, nurses, and accountants. And for those who truly want to keep work talk at bay, there's always the option of customer service reps and retail salespersons. Love truly knows no bounds (or job descriptions)! üíª‚ù§Ô∏èüçé

After not very careful examination of this graph I think the best action to take is to quit being a software enginner, become a middle school teacher and then marry with a software enginner. Everyone wins. Cheers.

I guess software engineers spend too long working and end up building relationships with fellow works who spend just as long at work? Maybe there is not enough time for many of them to venture out and date other human beings. With that said, second on the list, many software engineers build a home with elementary and middle school teachers, who often have a healthy work schedule. They can create a good balance. Going down the list, while there are various jobs, IT-related jobs, finance jobs, and teachers seem to make up most of the rest. However, in the end, it is love and not the job that attracts two people to one another.
